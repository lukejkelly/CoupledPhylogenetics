# CoupledPhylogenetics

This code repository accompanies the paper 'Lagged couplings diagnose Markov chain Monte Carlo phylogenetic inference' by L.J. Kelly, R.J. Ryder and G. Clart√©.

It contains various scripts to run marginal/coupled experiments in TraitLab and analyse the output:

* `simulate` contains Matlab scripts to generate synthetic data sets, parameter files for experiments and slurm submission scripts;
* `analyses` contains R scripts to analyse the output of experiments created via `simulate` and make figures.

README files in each the sub-directories describe how to run the code.
