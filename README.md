# CoupledPhylogenetics

This repo contains various scripts to run marginal/coupled experimetns in TraitLab and analyse the output.

* `simulate`: Matlab scripts to generate synthetic data sets and parameter files
* `analyses`: R scripts to analyse the output of experiments created via `simulate` and create figures

Many of the shell and analysis scripts are for my own use on my institutions compute cluster, but may serve as a guide for running experiments elsewhere.
